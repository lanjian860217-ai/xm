The Multiplier is calculated as 1, meaning that the Investor will open positions with the same volume as that of the Manager. A few minutes later the Manager deposits an extra $1,000 in his account bringing his total equity to $2,000, in this case &lt;strong&gt;the Multiplier for the subscription is updated automatically&lt;/strong&gt; from 1 to 0.5, meaning that if the Manager opens 1 lot the Investor will open 0.5 lots. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p class='text-base pb-2'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Multiplier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A fixed multiplier is selected by the Investor, and it shall remain fixed for the duration of the subscription to the Strategy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p class='pb-5'&gt; The Investor’s Volume will be calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='py-3 flex flex-col justify-center items-center' &gt;&lt;img class='dark:hidden' src='/assets/images/faqs/investor_volume.png' width='500'/&gt; &lt;img class='hidden dark:block' src='/assets/images/faqs/investor_volume-dark.png' width='500' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class='my-5' &gt;The Fixed Multiplier shall remain the same regardless of balance transactions taking place in the Manager’s account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Investor with $1,000 equity in his account chooses to use Fixed Multiplier of 1 to a Strategy with $1,000 equity.
